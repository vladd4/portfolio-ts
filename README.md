## Technologies used
 React: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables us to create dynamic and responsive web applications efficiently.
 TypeScript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds robustness to your code. It's particularly helpful when working on larger projects, as it provides better type checking and autocompletion.
 Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly build custom designs without writing custom CSS. Its simplicity and flexibility make it an excellent choice for creating visually appealing websites.
